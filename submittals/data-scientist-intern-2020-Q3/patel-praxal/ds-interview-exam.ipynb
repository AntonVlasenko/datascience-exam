We used recursion to reduce the complexity when finding the power of the matrix.

Since X, Y are random variables, we seek to minimize the expectation of the squared error loss as follows\n",

A model like k-nearest neighbors works in a Netflix or Amazon like setting, wherein we recommend items to users based on what similar users consumed.
