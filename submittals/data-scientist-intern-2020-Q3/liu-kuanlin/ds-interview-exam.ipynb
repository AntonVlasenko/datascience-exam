    "### Q 3.1 Why study gradient boosting or neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a regression setting where $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The goal is to come up with a function $f(X): \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that minimizes the squared-error loss $(Y - f(X))^2$. Since X, Y are random variables, we seek to minimize the expectation of the squared error loss as follows\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "EPE(f) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y-f(X)^2\\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where EPE stands for expected prediction error. One can show that minimizing the expected prediction error leads to the following _regression function_\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f(x) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[Y|X=x\\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of any method is to approximate the regression function above, which we denote as $\\hat{f}(x)$. For example, linear regression explicitly assumes that the regression function is approximately linear in its arguments, i.e. $\\hat{f}(x) = x^T\\beta$ while a neural network provides a nonlinear approximation of the regression function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of all these methods is [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm). Given $x$ and some neighbourhood of $k$ points $N_k(x)$, $\\hat{f}(x)$ is simply the average of all $y_i|x_i \\in N_k(x)$.  Let $N$ denote the training sample size. Under mild regularity conditions on the joint probability distribution $Pr(X, Y)$, one can show that as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $k/N \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\hat{f}(x) \\rightarrow f(x)$ where $\\rightarrow$ means approaches or goes to. In other words, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm converges to the ideal solution as both the training sample size and number of neighbors increase to infinity.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Data Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Before splitting the full dataset, I will first take a look at the distribution of the target variable in case that there exists the imbalanced dataset problem. Considering the size of the dataset is pretty small, first of all, I will randomly split the full dataset into two subsets, training and testing sets, with a percentage of 80% and 20%. In the training set, I will do 10-fold cross validation so that it will further be randomly splitted into 10 training-validation subsets. At this step, some upsampling or undersampling methods may be applied on the training set if the imbalanced problem exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dimension Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the assumption of this dataset, the feature size is way bigger than the sample size. Curse of dimenionality, which not only leads to high computation cost but also over-fitting problems, would happen here. There are some techniques I can try.\n",
    "\n",
    " - No feature selection: This could cause overfitting.\n",
    " - Filter method: Some features with high linear correlation to each other are redundant. A part of them can be removed. Also, this specific method also measures linear relationship.\n",
    " - Greedy: Backward and forward feature selection methods will take a high computation cost. I usually don't use them.\n",
    " - Regularization and tree-based models: These methods are directly connected with the models. For example, we can use decision trees on our numerical features to get feature importance. Besides, l1 and l2 regularization with logistic regression, SVM, and multilayer perceptron are common methods to reduce overfitting.\n",
    " - Dimension reduction techniques: Methods, like PCA, Multidimensional scaling, generate a new subset of features from the original feature sets.\n",
    " \n",
    "The methods above should be deeply explored in this hign-dimension dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "I would set up the pipeline starting from dimension reduction and model training. For model training, grid search and 10-fold cross validation for tuning hyperparameters are applied here. I will first try a wide range of hyperparameters based on grid search and then focus on a limited range by observing the metrics from 10-fold cross validation. Multiple models will be tested to see which one works better in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a classification problem, the metrics for regression models, such as MSE and MAE, are not suitable. Instead, accuracy, ROC, and f1-score should be applied. However, accuracy can be misleading according to imbalanced class distribution. Therefore, I would prefer to use ROC as the metrics when implementing cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model reliability and generalization ability are important during model assessment, I will observe learning rate for training loss and validation loss when training the model to avoid overfitting or underfitting."
